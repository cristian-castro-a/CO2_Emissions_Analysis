This is a personal project that aims to forecast the amount of CO2 emissions worldwide. The goal of this project is not only forecast in the near future the amount of CO2 emissions, but also to compare the using of [Prophet Model](https://facebook.github.io/prophet/) and [DARTS model](https://unit8co.github.io/darts/index.html) in Time Series Analysis.

## Data

The data used in this model is provided by Our World in Data: [CO2 Emissions - Our World in Data](https://github.com/owid/co2-data)
